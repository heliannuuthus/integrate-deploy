## Introduction
A github **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment**, built-in `java`, `rust`, `golang`, `node` different programming languages reusable workflow.

## Getting Started
For **Java** projects that use **gradle** as a build tool, it provides integrated configuration, supporting `single applications`, `cloud services`, `single project libraries`, and `multi-project libraries`.
